Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

A techincal concept I learned and had issues with during this project was angular. Angular is still in development and some of the documentaion is outdated so the resources avaliable were not always helpful.

What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

Despite the learning initial learning curve of having not used the MEAN stack before, I believe I was competent and trustworthy to finish tasks that were assigned to me on time.

What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

I was slower at learning the concepts behind MEAN stack compared to my group members. I can improve by working on my web development skills and reading further into documentations relating to the stack.
