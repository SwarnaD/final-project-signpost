###### What is your most significant individual contribution?

⋅⋅* Working on the front-end and making sure create-events, edit-events and view all events worked
for the user to see.


###### Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

⋅⋅* Learning how to use angular, express, mongodb and nodejs.  Previously I didnt know how to use
javascript for web design and my previous knowledge of java helped me transition easier.

###### What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

⋅⋅* I was able to learn how the MEAN stack worked and how a website functioned relatively quickly.
Also I felt like I was competent at bug-fixing when it came to a specific issue as I had a
working knowledge about the functionality of most pages.


###### What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

⋅⋅* I was busy with other assignments and tests during the semester so I was not able to sit down
and implement visuals to the website using bootstrap.  In terms of improvement I would say 
I need to spend my time more wisely because I did not schedule when to study or work on 
an assignment, I just worked on everything without rest so now my sleeping schedule is out of sync.
I don't sleep anymore.....I just pass out and wake up in a groggy haze for more assignments.
