## What is your most significant individual contribution?
Each member of our team had little to no prior knowledge working with our tech stack. I made sure to first understand the components of the project myself, so that I could set up the project bones properly and help my team along such that everyone was on track from the beginning. I initially set up inter-component communication and implemented a significant portion of the functionality so that my teammates could use my work as reference and build scalable (working) code on top of it, and made myself available for reference as often as possible, helping to work on features as needed.

## Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
The web framework model (MVC, frontend/backend components) was very foreign to me at the beginning of the project. By tackling the project head on and writing the entire project organization from the ground up (several times), I have become significantly more confident in my knowledge of how web frameworks are implemented, and have come to understand that there is no true "best practice". Instead, knowing how the individual components communicate is enough to develop my own "best practices" and transfer those skills to other systems such as Django or Ruby on Rails, which I have been hesitant to work with in the past.

## What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
I communicate clearly with my team. Throughout the project, I made sure to keep my teammates updated on what I was working on, what I had missed, and provided any resources that would be helpful towards understanding any trickier bits.

I am reliable. I did my share of the work and consistently hit deadlines. At no point was anyone waiting on me to finish implementing something they needed to be done in order to start their work.

I am organized. I kept up to date on all the project requirements for our team, wrote the documentation, and helped to keep everyone in the loop regarding deadlines.

## What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
I am overly critical. I expect work quality from both me and my team that sometimes is not possible given deadlines and other constraints.

I tend to push ahead, requiring extra time from me and my teammates to fill in any conceptual gaps I may have created.
