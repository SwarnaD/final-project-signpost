## Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.

For our project our team decided to learn and use MEAN stack to develop our website. However, due to our lack of knowledge, the first technique we tried was to split up the tasks into the sections frontend and backend. This ended up going against us early on as we realized that much of the project had various interlocking features between the front and back end. As a result of this some components became disjoint and much code had to be refactored.

Another convention we had in the beginning was making our meetings online rather than in person. With this, it made the meetings were more prone to being skipped or brushed to the side as there was no exact time allocated. Additionally, it was noticeably more difficult to explain large sections of code through texts and voice chat than it would have been in person. 

## Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.

Following our second sprint, we decided to begin dividing up tasks by feature instead of by component. By this point, each team member had a solid grasp of how our entire tech stack worked, so we could more efficiently implement features separately rather than having to wait on each other to build/finish/debug individual frontend/backend components.

We also found that having regular in-person meetings was beneficial towards having everyone on the same page both conceptually and technically. By meeting in person, we could utilize pseudo-pair-programming, and also discuss aspects of our project that would be difficult to via online messaging.

## If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like? In other words, describe an ideal process for your team, based on your experience working together.

By the end of our four weeks working together, we became rather efficient. After having worked out kinks like scheduling conflicts and task distribution, our velocity increased significantly. To continue such a process, ideally we would be able to allocate specific times for meetings, pair-programming and other code review. We would however choose to elongate sprints, as we had little time to properly implement features and often found tasks spilling over to the next sprint.

If we had to do it from the beginning over again, we would allocate perhaps a week or so to get everyone on the same page with regards to implementation and conceptualization so that we could hit the ground running right after, instead of the trial-and-error way we experimented initially, requiring us to do significant refactorization.
