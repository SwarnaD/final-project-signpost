 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 My most significant contribution would be my work on the backend involving management of the database as well as making the API (including documentation).
 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 A technical concept I learned was how the front end and back end of a website communicates using a fullstack such as MEAN.  I have never used a fullstack before so it was quite intriguing working it out.
 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
As a team member my main strength would be my knowledge and understanding of the project as a whole.  With this I was able to help break the project into its components to divide the work as well as be able to debug on both front and backend.
 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
My main weakness would be communicating to my team what I am doing.  More often than not I would just work on whatever I could whenever I could so that I can balance my schedule.  This made the project prone to becoming disjoint where team members do not know what has been done already.  To correct this I tried writing API documentation for anyone to refer to.
