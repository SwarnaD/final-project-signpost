## Competition

#### Facebook 

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) lets users create groups that can post events, and users may be invited by administrators, who can be allowed to invite other users.

**Our product is different in that it targets University of Toronto students and groups.** Facebook targets a worldwide audience, so the reach of groups and students on Facebook is limited by unestablished standards of practice and exposure only through connected users. Facebook would not benefit from targetting a local audience like ours (i.e. they have bigger fish to fry). Our product will not rely on connections, and will allow users and groups immediate full access to the platform's capabilities. Doing so, we will take maximum advantage of our local audience.

#### Ulife

[Ulife](https://www.ulife.utoronto.ca/) is the University of Toronto's official student life webpage. It has a directory of clubs and groups on campus, but does not provide a way for students to receive a live feed of groups' activities. In this regard, Ulife is solely informational; they allow groups to post contact information, and leaves students to look into and contact the groups by themselves.

**Our product is different in that it is more of a means of communication between groups and students, more akin to a bulletin board as opposed to a directory.**
