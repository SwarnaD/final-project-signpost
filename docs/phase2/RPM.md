Attendees: Adam Lee, Frank Xie, Joseph Lee, Justin Mao

### Issues Considered

**What tech stack should we use?**
MEAN: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js

**What are our project objectives?**
See [summary.md](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/final-project-signpost/blob/master/docs/phase1/summary.md).

**What features will we focus on implementing?**
First we must implement user registration/authentication, group creation and
event creation as the project's 'skeleton', so to speak. To do this,
we need to first set up our tech stack's basics, and understand how they
communicate internally.
