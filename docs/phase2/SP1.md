## Sprint 1 Experience

Overall, our sprint 1 was unsuccessful. We set out to gain experience and understand the technologies we were working with by implementing user registration/authentication, but we did not do so as well as we had hoped. Moving forward, we must catch up and carefully prioritize for our next sprint.
