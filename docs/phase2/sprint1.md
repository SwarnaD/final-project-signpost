## Issues Considered

**How should we begin implementation?**  
We will implement features step by step by which a potential user might use, so that we can better visualize our process.

In particular, we must first setup the skeleton of the code we will write, installing any needed dependencies.

**What user stories will we implement during this sprint?**  
See [sprint backlog](#sprint-backlog).
