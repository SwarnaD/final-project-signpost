## Team Organization

We have divided our team up into roles with respect to implementation:
Frontend (AngularJS, HTML, CSS): Justin Mao
Front/back Communication (AngularJS, Express): Frank Xie
Backend (Express, Node.js): Selby Gomes, Joseph Lee
Backend/DB (Express, Node.js, MongoDB): Adam Lee

## Decision Making

Our decisions thus far have been made through group consensus (there have been few decisions to make).

## Priority of User Stories

We have not yet set up user stories, we plan to begin after the lecture on using Pivotal Tracker this coming Friday, March 3, 2017).

## Meetings

We have met in person to discuss the project moving forward, but our primary means of communication is online, where we discuss decisions nearly daily.

## Moving Forward

At this point, our project has clear objectives that we will begin to tackle.
