Scrum master: Justin Mao (Skype)

Attendees: Adam Lee (Skype), Frank Xie (Skype), Joseph Lee (Skype), Selby Gomes (Skype)

Time: Friday, March 17, 2017 @ 2 PM

## Issues Considered

**What are we planning for release and how will we divide tasks into stages until then?**  
Focus primarily on function this week, so that the essentials are completed. Next week we will work on the user experience and UI, as well as some extra inessential features.

**How will we divide up tasks this sprint?**  
We will divide tasks up by features rather than components this week, to alleviate the burden of communication issues.

**What user stories will we implement during this sprint?**
* Event Creation
* Add tags to users/events
* Event details
* Follow event
* Campus specification
* Follow group

## Sprint backlog

### User Stories

**Event Creation**  
* Points: 5
* As a group coordinator I want to be able to advertise group events in a manner that allows me to reach out to potentially interested students at UofT.
* Assignment: Joseph Lee/Frank Xie

**Add tags to users/events**  
* Points: 5
* As a student new to the community, I want to be able to browse events that I might be interested so that I can go out and do things I want to do without knowing anyone beforehand.
* Assignment: Adam Lee (+ Justin Mao if Adam needs help)

**Event details**  
* Points: 3
* As an event coordinator, I want people to see details about my event, so that they are able to attend without further instruction.
* Assignment: Joseph Lee/Frank Xie

**Campus specification**  
* Points: 2
* As a student at UTM who lives in downtown Toronto, I want to be able to find events at UTSG so that I can attend them without looking for flyers on the UTSG campus.
* Assignment: Joseph Lee

**Follow group**  
* Points: 5
* As a person that does not fluently speak English, I want to be able to find and join in on extracurricular activities consistently with the same group without fearing miscommunication.
* Assignment: Selby Gomes/Justin Mao

### Other Tasks
