## Unfinished Tasks

**Event Creation**  
Write controller/view logic (tweak API creation call and data display).

## Practices

**Continue:**  
Regular meetings between communicating parties to stay on top of and synchronize story and task work.

**New:**  
Divide tasks up by features rather than component (MVC, frontend/backend).

**Discontinue:**  
Divide up tasks by component (MVC, frontend/backend). It is difficult to coordinate between group members working on the same feature when the frontend/backend is inconsistent.

## Sprint 2 Experience

Since Sprint 1, we have gotten our project on track. Our codebase is solid, and we as a group have a better understanding of what we are trying to achieve. From here on forward, we should be able to implement new features smoothly.
