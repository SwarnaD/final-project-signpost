## Team Organization

We have divided our team up into roles with respect to implementation:
1. Frontend (AngularJS, HTML, CSS): Justin Mao
2. Front/back Communication (AngularJS, Express): Frank Xie
3. Backend (Express, Node.js): Selby Gomes, Joseph Lee
4. Backend/DB (Express, Node.js, MongoDB): Adam Lee

## Decision Making

Our decisions thus far have been made through group consensus (there have been few decisions to make).

## Priority of User Stories

Our user stories will use MoSCoW analysis to decide priority. Each story will be classified into:
* M(ust)
* S(hould)
* C(ould)
* W(on't)

Within each classification, stories will be ranked by preference.

## Meetings

We have met in person to discuss the project moving forward, but our primary means of communication is online, where we discuss decisions nearly daily.

## Moving Forward

At this point, our project has clear objectives that we will begin to tackle.
