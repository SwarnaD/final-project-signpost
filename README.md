## Project Objective 

Our objective is to create a platform on which University of Toronto students can receive a 'feed' of events from University of Toronto clubs and other groups that they may have interest in. Students will be able to list interests, and will receive notifications for events posted by groups relevant to those interests; groups will be able to increase their exposure and reach an expanded intended audience using this platform.

## Key Personas

Our target audience consists of students seeking to find interesting events to attend in the University of Toronto community, and University of Toronto groups looking to expand their audience reach in the right direction.

## Key Services

Groups will be able to maintain a group page, create events, and are managed by users who are administrative group members.

Students will be able to register with a University of Toronto email, log in, and maintain a list of interests as well as a list of groups to follow. Once logged in, the student will see events from those interests and groups that will be pushed to the student's homepage feed. If the student is an administrator member of a University of Toronto group, they will be able to create or join the administrative team of the group on our platform.

## Key Principles

Ease of use: Users should interact with an interface that is intuitive and fluid.
Efficiency: Code should be written such that it runs in an efficient manner.
Reliable code: Code should be well tested and function correctly.
